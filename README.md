proto-less.js
==============
A macro library for less, used by protolus.

Usage
-----
Currently this is very disorganized and subject to flux

There are a few different files:
- *colors* : macros for color/colorscheme manipulation
- *geometry* : macros for handling container sizing and placement
- *macros* : everything else goes here
- *reset* : this is just a simple style reset for the browser
- *textures* : this is a macro set for colorized textures through semi-transparent greyscale textures

Enjoy,
